# C++ Algorithms and Data Structures Workspace

This repository contains a collection of C++ implementations for various algorithms, data structures, and programming concepts. The code is organized into topic-based folders for easy navigation and learning.

## Folder Structure

- **Data Structures/**: Implementations of trees and related algorithms.
- **Multithreading/**: Examples of multithreaded programming (e.g., Producer-Consumer problem).
- **Sliding Window/**: Algorithms using the sliding window technique.
- **SmartPointers/**: Usage examples of C++ smart pointers.
- **Socket Programming/**: Basic client-server socket programming examples.
- **STL/**: Standard Template Library usage and custom data structures (Stack, Queue, Linked Lists, Heap, etc.).
- **Strings/**: String manipulation and algorithm examples.

## How to Build & Run

1. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `cd STL/Stack`).
2. Use the provided `makefile` (if available):
   ```sh
   make
   ./app_static
   ```
   Or compile manually:
   ```sh
   g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
   ./output_file
   ```

## Requirements
- C++11 or later
- GNU Make (for folders with makefiles)
- g++ compiler
